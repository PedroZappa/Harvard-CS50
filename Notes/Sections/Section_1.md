## Why are we using C?

## How can we `read` and `write` code that includes `variables`, `conditionals`, and `loops`?

## Why do we care about `data types`?

## What does it mean to `compile` a C program?

## How many years will it take to double our llamas?

___

## Types and format codes

### Numbers

- int (%i)

- long (%li)

- float (%f)

- double (%f)

### Text

- char (%c)

- string (%s)

## Problem Solving Formula

- Work an example yourself;
- Write down exactly what you did;
- Create an algorithm after working multiple examples;
- Test your algorithm by hand;
- Translate your algorithm to code;
- Find errors in your code by running test cases;
- Fix errors in your code;

### Llama Problem

- We have a population of `n` llamas;
- Each year `n/3` new llamas are born, and `n/4` llamas pass away;
- How many years will it take to have a certain population of llamas?

### Llama Problem Algorithm

- Prompt the user for a `starting number` of llamas;
- Prompt the user for a `dgoal number` of llamas;
- `Add and subtract llamas every "year"` until we reach the goal number of llamas;
- `Print the number of years` it took to reach the goal number of llamas;
