Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: The predictions point to the similar conclusions with small and large values of N

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 1000 would be the sweet spot.
